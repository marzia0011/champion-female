Alexia Putellas Segura (Catalan: Alèxia Putellas i Segura,[3][4][5][6] pronounced [alɛksˈiə puteʎəs];[7] born 4 February 1994) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Barcelona, which she captains, and the Spain national team.[8] She previously played for Espanyol and Levante, and has represented Catalonia. Having won all major club and individual awards available to a European player by 2022,[9][10] she is widely regarded as the best contemporary female footballer in the world, and one of the greatest of all time.[11][12][13][14][15]

Putellas has played for Barcelona since 2012, after spending most of her youth career in the ranks of Espanyol. With Barcelona, she has won six league titles, seven Copas de la Reina, and one UEFA Women's Champions League title. In Barcelona's 2020–21 season, she played an essential role as her team won the Champions League as well as the resulting continental treble, both for the first time in their history. Putellas then went on to win the UEFA Women's Player of the Year Award, the Ballon d'Or Féminin, and The Best FIFA Women's Player in 2021, becoming the first player to win all three in the same year. In 2022, despite missing the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 due to injury, she won the UEFA Women's Player of the Year Award and the Ballon d'Or Féminin, each for a second consecutive year, making her the first woman to do so.[9]

On the international stage, Putellas had success with Spain's youth national teams, winning two UEFA Women's U-17 Euros (in 2010 and 2011) as well as finishing second place in the 2012 UEFA Women's U-19 Euro. She made her debut for Spain's senior national team in 2013, and has since featured in three major international competitions with the team: Spain's FIFA Women's World Cup debut in 2015, the 2017 UEFA Women's Euro, and the 2019 World Cup.

As of 2022, Putellas has the second-most all-time appearances for Barcelona behind former left back Melanie Serrano, and is currently their second-highest all-time scorer behind former striker Jennifer Hermoso.[16][17][18] She also holds the record of most appearances for Spain with 100 caps, having surpassed Marta Torrejón's previous record of 90 caps in 2021.
